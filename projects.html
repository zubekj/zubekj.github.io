<h4>MLPPI</h4>
<p><a href="http://zubekj.github.io/mlppi/">MLPPI</a> stands for Multi-level machine-learning Prediction of Protein-protein Interactions. It is an universal tool aimed at predicting pairwise protein interactions basing only on protein sequences.</p>

<h4>Skarb</h4>
<p>During my master studies I co-developed <a href="https://github.com/skarb/skarb">Skarb</a> â€“ an experimental Ruby to C compiler with some interesting memory management optimisations. If you are interested in memory management in script languages interpreters you can read my <a href="zubekj_msc_thesis.pdf">master thesis</a>.</p>
