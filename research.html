<h2>Current interests</h2>

<ul>

<li>Characteristics of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods in the
context of cognitive science. Properties shared between artificial and
biological systems.</li>  
  
<li>Formal models of categorization, links between human category learning and data complexity.</li>
  
<li>Coordination and multimodal synchrony in collective cognitive systems (e.g. committees of experts).</li>

</ul>

<b>Past research topics</b>

<ul>
<li>Machine learning with emphasis on ensemble classifiers, classifiers diversity,
  data complexity and methods for building consensus from multiple predictions.</li>

<li>Applications of machine learning in bioinformatics. Facilitating reconstruction
of protein interaction network by predicting not yet observed interactions based
on the available experimental data.</li>
</ul>
