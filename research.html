<h2>Research</h2>

<p>
I firmly believe that most human cognition occurs in interaction, concerns other people, and is influenced by the interactive environment. I adopt a dynamical perspective, emphasizing the importance of studying real-time, embodied processes rather than just their final outcomes. In my research, I frequently use pose tracking techniques to quantify movement patterns during naturalistic interpersonal interactions. Additionally, I develop agent-based models to explore interactive phenomena.</p>

<b>Past research topics</b>

<ul>
<li>Formal models of categorization, links between human category learning and data complexity.</li>

<li>Machine learning with the emphasis on ensemble classifiers, classifiers diversity,
  data complexity, and methods for building consensus from multiple predictions.</li>

<li>Applications of machine learning in bioinformatics. Facilitating reconstruction
of protein interaction network by predicting not yet observed interactions based
on the available experimental data.</li>
</ul>
