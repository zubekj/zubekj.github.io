{"name":"Julian Zubek","tagline":"homepage","body":"I am a programmer and data scientist with an unusual predilection for unapplied social sciences.\r\n\r\nCurrently I work at the [Laboratory of Functional and Structural Genomics, CeNT UW](http://nucleus3d.cent.uw.edu.pl/). I also pursue PhD at the [Institute of Computer Science, PAS](http://www2.ipipan.waw.pl/index.php/en/).\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\nDuring my master studies I co-developed [Skarb](https://github.com/skarb/skarb) – an experimental Ruby to C compiler with some interesting optimizations of memory management.\r\n\r\nNow I am active in research concerning cognitive systems, machine learning and its applications in bioinformatics. You can find the list of my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a_9-qrcAAAAJ).\r\n\r\nSome by-products of my scientific activity can be found as code repositories on my [Github account](https://github.com/zubekj/).\r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\n\r\nI had the pleasure to teach at [Summer School of Data Analysis 2015](http://www.delab.uw.edu.pl/szkola-letnia-dane-2015/) organized by DELab UW. Teaching materials are available [here](https://github.com/DELabUW/szkola-letnia-2015) (in Polish).\r\n\r\nI teach a course “Introduction to modelling of cognitive processes” at University of Warsaw. You can find a short summary in a form of a comic [here](./cogsys_comic.pdf) (in Polish).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
