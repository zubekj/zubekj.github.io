<p>I am a cognitive scientist with a keen interest in studying fundamental aspects of interpersonal interactions.</p>

<p>My formal background is in computer science, and my PhD thesis focused on applications of machine learning in bioinformatics. Currently, I work as an assistant professor at the <a href="http://hill.psych.uw.edu.pl/">Human Interactivity and Language Lab</a> within the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Warsaw.</p>

<p>Here is my full <a href="zubekj_cv.pdf">CV</a>.</p>
