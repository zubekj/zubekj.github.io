<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I value a good book, imaginative conversation, and Chinese tea drank from a sky blue bowl. During summer I like backpacking in some nice mountains, preferably forested.</p>

<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<p>Martial arts are among my long-lasting interests. I used to practice judo for many years. Now I study yiquan – a modern style of kung fu which emphasises spontaneity and the usage of imagination during training. You can visit the site of my school: <a href="http://www.yiquan.pl">Akademia Yiquan</a> or <a href="http://www.yiquan.academy">Yiquan Academy</a>.</p>

<p>I am interested in various personality typologies, most notably socionics, which is a post-jungian typology heavily influenced by Antoni Kępiński's concept of information metabolism. I participate in editing a <a href="http://www.socjonika.pl">Polish site</a> about this system with an active <a href="http://forum.socjonika.pl">forum</a>.</p>
